            If i have to learn about people i don't know meeting each other and then becoming important, <time>I'd like to know why they're important</time>. Outside of having some presentation at an early tech comic-con, basically. <strong>I guess all of these tech guys didn't have any friends</strong> until they met each other cause they were a <small>little</small> too <sup>excited</sup> to collab. Too many names, too much exposition, not enough clearly stated facts that. <i>Bardini loves Engelbart</i>. But like, why was the teletypewriter considered a computer, <b>it didn't have a <button>motherfuckin'</button> screen</b>.

                I think the <b>teletypewriter </b>was considered a computer because of its function rather than the form it took. Similar to how the term <cite>technology</cite> not always <i>being limited to tech products, but of something that is a new innovation </i>.
