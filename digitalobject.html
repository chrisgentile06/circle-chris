            <h1> Elle Kennedy Multiverse </h1>
            <h2> The hockey smut that is taking the world by storm...</h2>
            <p> Elle Kennedy is a canadian writer best known for her work <i>The Deal</i>, a romance novel that follows singer, Hannah, and captain of the hockey team, Garret. Their unlikley romance inspired a whole series following their friends, then a spin-off series following some of the teammates, and now a new series following their children. Kennedy is pumping these books out like her life depends on it. And thank god for that.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the book covers that are sold to the general public are super embarrassing. So the image you see above was created by me. I made four covers for the original four books but i won't subject you to all of them. Just one more.</p>
