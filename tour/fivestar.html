            <p>The best of the best... books that changed the way I think, the way I see the world, and the way I interact with it. Just a few of them. There are a few authors who I favor, almost all of their books are put into this category, but the ones featured on this page are their stand-out titles. I'm a lover of Haruki Murakami and the way he paints surreal worlds and drops strange characters into them as vessels for the reader to explore. Patti Smith is a classic New York name, her non-fiction still leaves you drowning in prose. Smiths poetry is undeniably legendary. Donna Tartt is the master of dark academia, no one compares. Sally Rooney, oh Sally Rooney... the hold you have on me... Everyone loves Normal People, but when I read her most recent work, Intermezzo, I was dumbfounded. I cried when I finished because it meant leaving that world. Rooney successfully pulls off the third-person-omniscient point of view which allows the reader to know each characters intentions and thoughts as they continue to miscommunicate with one another. It's incredibly human. </p>
